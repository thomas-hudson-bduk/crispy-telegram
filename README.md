### Best Practices for GitHub and Folder Structure

To maintain a clean and organized repository, consider following these best practices:

1. Use meaningful and descriptive names for your scripts and directories to provide clarity and ease of navigation.

2. Include a README file in each script's directory that provides instructions, dependencies, and usage examples specific to that script.

3. Utilize version control effectively by making frequent and descriptive commits. Include clear commit messages to provide context and make it easier to track changes.

4. Consider using branches for different features or experiments, making it easier to manage and merge changes.

5. Include a `requirements.txt` file to document the necessary dependencies for running the scripts. This helps others replicate your environment easily.

6. Encourage collaboration by including contribution guidelines and a code of conduct in the repository. This promotes a healthy and inclusive community.

7. Regularly review and update your repository to address issues, incorporate feedback, and keep your scripts up to date with any new versions or changes.

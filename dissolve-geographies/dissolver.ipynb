    "The function ```dissolve_geometries()``` takes four parameters: ```main_file```, ```join_file```, ```output_file```, and ```log_file```:\n",
    "- ```main_file``` represents the main GeoJSON file containing the primary geometries.\n",
    "- ```join_file``` represents the GeoJSON file containing the geometries to join with the main file.\n",
    "- ```output_file``` is the desired output location for the dissolved data.\n",
    "- ```log_file``` is the file where log details are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function performs the following steps:\n",
    "1. Loads the main and join GeoJSON files into separate GeoDataFrames.\n",
    "2. Reprojects the main data to match the CRS of the join data.\n",
    "3. Performs a spatial join to associate each join feature with the corresponding main feature.\n",
    "4. Dissolves the join geometries within each main feature into a single polygon per main feature.\n",
    "5. Saves the dissolved data to a new GeoJSON file.\n",
    "6. Logs script run details, including the current timestamp, file names, and output file location, to the log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution times for each step are measured and printed during the execution of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This generalized approach allows you to dissolve geometries from any pair of GeoJSON files based on their spatial relationship and save the result to a new file, while also logging the details of the script run."
